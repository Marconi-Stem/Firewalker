# Notes

## 1. Introduction

The Firewalker LED light project was inspired by Becky Stern. It uses a small microcontroller called the Gemma M0(add sound?) and a string of multi-colored lights called the *NeoPixel*

At the Chatham Marconi Museum, we decided to use her ideas and parts list to make a set of lights that can be placed on a bike helmet or sewn to the front or back of a coat. 

## 2. Hardware  
### 2.1 Supplies list
  
These instructions were written **FOR:**
1. ONE - Adafruit **GEMMA M0 board**: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501),
