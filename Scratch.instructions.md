============================================================

  * Welcome & Icebreaker: What is programming? Why learn it?
  * Introduction to Scratch:
    * Sign-up class to Scratch Act
    * Interface overview (Sprites, Stage, Blocks Palette, Scripts Area).
      * Basic movement & animation (e.g., moving a sprite, changing costumes).
      * Understanding Sequencing of commands.
   * Hands-on Activity: Create a simple animated story or a sprite that moves across the screen.

### B. Control Flow & Interactivity

   * Loops:
      * Introduce *repeat blocks*, avoid repetitive code.
      * Hands-on Activity: Make a sprite draw a shape using loops.
   * Conditionals or Branching:
      * Introduce *if* and *if/else* blocks for decision-making.
      * Hands-on Activity: Create a simple game where a sprite reacts to touching another object or a specific color.
   * Events or Inputs:
      * Explore when *green flag* clicked, when *key pressed*, when *sprite clicked blocks.
   * Project: Students create a short interactive game or story incorporating loops, conditionals, and events.
