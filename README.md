??? 9 AM -12 PM, Aug 5-7, 2025, Marconi Summer STEM course

The *Marconi-version Firewalker Protective Lights* is a set of colorful flashing lights to be placed on a bike helmet or sewn to the front or back of a coat.

# 1. Introduction

The [Firewalker LED light project](https://learn.adafruit.com/firewalker-led-sneakers/overview) was inspired by Becky Stern. It uses the Gemma M0, a small microcontroller board and a string of multi-colored lights called the [NeoPixel](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels?embeds=allow).

At the Chatham Marconi Museum, we decided to a set of colorful lights to be placed on a bike helmet or sewn to the front or back of a coat.
