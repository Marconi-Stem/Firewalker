??? 9 AM -12 PM, Aug 5-7, 2025, Marconi Summer STEM course

The *'Firewalker' Protective Lights* is a set of colorful flashing lights that may be placed on a bike helmet or sewn to the front or back of a coat.

# 1. Introduction



The *'Firewalker' Protective Lights* uses the [Gemma M0](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gemma-m0) (a small microcontroller) and a string of multi-colored leds aligned on a strip. The LEDS are called the [NeoPixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels?embeds=allow).
